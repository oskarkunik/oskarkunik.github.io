<p>I&rsquo;ve been a Pocket user for years, however I never really liked the interface and the fact that it&rsquo;s a closed-source cloud service with advertisements and social sharing/suggestions. All I need is a list of links, preferably with titles. Then there&rsquo;s also <a href="https://www.wallabag.it/en">Wallabag</a>, which I self-hosted for a while, but it&rsquo;s still way to complex for my use case.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://syncthing.net/">Syncthing</a> to keep my files in sync between my computers and phone. For a long time I&rsquo;ve been thinking to utilize this system for links I want to save for later.</p>
<p>The solution I came up with uses Syncthing, my todo.txt file, as well as a Python script for getting the titles of websites. It&rsquo;s called gothos, and here&rsquo;s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any link that I want to save for later is added as a new line in my todo.txt file.</li>
<li>todo.txt is then synced periodially with other machines. One of them is a Raspberry Pi Zero W, which acts as a tiny local network server.</li>
<li>On the Raspberry there&rsquo;s a bash which fires <code>todo_parser.py</code>. To achieve this I created <code>gothos_cron</code> (with permissions changed to <code>sudo chmod +x 777</code>) to <code>/etc/cron.hourly/</code> with the following content:</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#!/bin/bash

python3 /home/pi/gothos/todo_parser.py
</code></pre><ol start="4">
<li><code>todo_parser.py</code> then goes through <code>todo.txt</code> looking for lines that match the URL regex pattern.</li>
<li>If a line contains a valid URL and it doesn&rsquo;t already have a &ldquo;+parsed&rdquo; tag, the website gets fetched and <code>todo_parser.py</code> tries to scrape its title.</li>
<li>The line in <code>todo.txt</code> is then replaced with
<code>&lt;scraped website title&gt; &lt;original url&gt; +parsed</code></li>
<li>On the Raspberry there&rsquo;s also a small Python server running which hosts a simple page that parses the <code>todo.txt</code> file and renders a list of clickable links using basic JavaScript. The server is running as a systemd service that autostarts on reboot. I stole the idea for the CSS from <a href="https://n-o-d-e.net">NODE</a>, where links are displayed in a similar way.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. It is definitely taped together and sometimes fails silently, but most of the time it works just fine. There&rsquo;s a wonderful feel of a Rube Goldberg machine to it. It is not available outside of my local network and has a limited feature set (e.g. I need to edit the <code>todo.txt</code> file manually to remove entries), but I like the flexibility of parsing, filtering and displaying the list of saved links however I wish.</p>
<p>All in all it&rsquo;s been a fun project to do in my spare time.</p>
<p>Things that I may one day improve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better error handling in <code>todo_parser.py</code>. Currently only the errors that came up so far are handled in any way.</li>
<li>Better code. I didn&rsquo;t care for the implementation to be pretty, but could and should be.</li>
<li>Matching some of the platforms in <code>todo_parser.py</code> to clean the links and maybe use alternatives (like yewtu.be) Some way to filter the links on page,</li>
<li>Displaying the url below/next to the title.</li>
</ul>
