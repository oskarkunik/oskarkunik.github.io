      <description>Syncing with Syncthing Syncthing is definitely one of the things I set up as quickly as I can on a new device. I use it for:
 syncing wallpapers between desktop devices, making automatic backups of pictures on my phone, keeping music files in sync between all devices (phone and PCs), maintaining one todo.txt file that I can access everywhere, having my savegames synced across devices, so that I can play on any one of them and have the progress propagated to other machines.</description>

      <description>self-hosted bookmarks I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Pocket user for years, however I never really liked the interface and the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s a closed-source cloud service with advertisements and social sharing/suggestions. All I need is a list of links, preferably with titles. Then there&amp;rsquo;s also Wallabag, which I self-hosted for a while, but it&amp;rsquo;s still way to complex for my use case.
I use Syncthing to keep my files in sync between my computers and phone.</description>
